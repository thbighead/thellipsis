    <p class="thellipsis" style="width: 50%;">The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy has a few things to
        say on the subject of towels. A towel, it says, is about the most massivelyuseful thing an interstellar hitch
        hiker can have. Partly it has great practical value - you can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across
        the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V,
        inhaling the heady sea vapours; you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert
        world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a mini raft down the slow heavy river Moth; wet it for use in
        hand-to-hand-combat; wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes or to avoid the gaze of the Ravenous
        Bugblatter Beast of Traal (a mindboggingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see it, it can't see you
        - daft as a bush, but very ravenous); you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of course
        dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean enough. More importantly, a towel has immense
        psychological value. For some reason, if a strag (strag: non-hitch hiker) discovers that a hitch hiker has his
        towel with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of a toothbrush, face flannel, soap,
        tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat spray, wet weather gear, space suit etc., etc.
        Furthermore, the strag will then happily lend the hitch hiker any of these or a dozen other items that the hitch
        hiker might accidentally have "lost". What the strag will think is that any man who can hitch the length and
        breadth of the galaxy, rough it, slum it, struggle against terrible odds, win through, and still knows where his
        towel is clearly a man to be reckoned with.</p>
